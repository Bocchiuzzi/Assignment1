            <p2>I am currently in my second year of the Game Programming diploma at Centennial College.<br>
                This program also has me learning a fair amount of software development, which I feel<br>
                is an advantageous addition to my skill set. <br><br><br><br>
                
                I hold a bachelor's degree from Nipissing University in Classical History focusing on Greek and Roman history.<br>            
                There is much to be learned history that can be applied to our lives today, and it is my firmly held belief that <br> 
                it is imperative to learn from the past in order to create a better future.<br><br><br><br>        
                
                Having spent the better part of my adult life backpacking around the world I am familiar and comfortable with many <br>
                cultures and people. This has lead me to develop a keen understanding of people, their needs and motivations, and <br> 
                how to interact appropriately with anyone I might have dealings with. I am sensitive to cultural differences and <br>
                thoroughly enjoy the challenges associated with navigating those social interactions.
